## TODO

* [ ] Collision manager to allow collision callbacks in Lua scripts
* [ ] Add script update hook
* [ ] Create design document
* [ ] Consistent naming of `2D` classes & files (should be e.g. `water_2d_manager.h` for `Water2DManager`)
* [ ] Fix blocked cell checks for `FlowField2D` (sampled directions can point into a blocked cell diagonally without correction)

## Four Pillars
