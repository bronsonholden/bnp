# About

BNP is a return-to-roots, so to speak. It is—in essence, though not in reality—a video game engine.
I began building it to refresh myself on C++ and dive deeper into some of the software patterns
that are prevalent in video game engines. Specifically, I was interested in ECS, game data saving
(both static data and gamesaves), and advanced rendering techniques.

Though it may never become an actual game, it has a few interesting capabilities: pixel-style
planet rendering using layered Perlin noise with tools to alter them to produce a rich variety
of worlds, Earth-like or otherwise; a generic and flexible marshaling interface (using plenty of
mind-twisting metaprogramming); and a Lua script interface.

Game engines, like all software, are perpetually WIP, and this one may be so for a long while.
